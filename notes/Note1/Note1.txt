Always move onto adjacent food
1 Always try to move to spaces that are adjacent to few lit spaces
	How to fit diagonals into this?
	2 Among those, try to move to spaces that have lit spaces 2 away
0 If 1 is not possible, move into spaces that are already lit

Improve logic for rule_0_prev_dir
Create list of valid directions at start of pick_direction
Diagonal cell check
Add check_local for 2 cells away
"Soften" the shader to make things look more organic, less obviously on a grid
Config with weights for determining movement
Improve food placement to fill in interpolated cells
Multiple colors and different behavior around differently colored tunnels
Should is_in_bounds receive the maze? Or a cleaner way?
